Puppet RHEL Hardening Module
===========================

Originally forked from jamtur01/puppet-hardening and amended for RHEL6, this module covers the basics of server hardening. This is NOT the complete set of controls - merely a selection.

It should be very easy to use the provided control examples and add the additional controls contained in RHEL CIS Benchmark.
