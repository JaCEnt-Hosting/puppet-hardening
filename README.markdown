Puppet CIS Hardening Module
===========================

This module shows how to harden your Red Hat, CentOS or Fedora host according to the Centre for Internet Security 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (RHEL5) CIS Benchmark Version 1.1 (April 2008).  This is NOT the complete set of controls - merely a selection.

It should be very easy to use the provided control examples and add the additional controls contained in the Benchmark.
